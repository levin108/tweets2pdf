5. YOU NEED TO KNOW
-------------------
	1. Twitter has API limitation every hour, so sometimes
 you can not get enough data you want, but we make it try
 as many times as we can, until it runs out.

	2. You can only fetch your lastest 3200 tweets because of
the limitation of the API.

	3. For the first time you run tweets2pdf, you need to complete 
the configuration first, go to 'Preference', and specify a font file,
and then save it.
